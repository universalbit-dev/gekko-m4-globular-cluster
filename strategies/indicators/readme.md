The provided files contain various technical indicators used in trading strategies. Here's an explanation of each:

### AO.js (Awesome Oscillator)
- **Purpose**: Measures market momentum.
- **Logic**: Uses two simple moving averages (SMA) of median prices. The difference between the short-term (5-period) and long-term (34-period) SMA gives the oscillator value.

### DX.js (Directional Movement Indicator)
- **Purpose**: Identifies the strength of a trend.
- **Logic**: Uses True Range (ATR) and calculates directional movement (DM) values. It then computes the directional index (DI) and the DX value based on these.

### UO.js (Ultimate Oscillator)
- **Purpose**: Combines three different time frames to reduce false signals.
- **Logic**: Calculates buying pressure (BP) and true range (TR) for three periods. It then combines these with specific weights to compute the ultimate oscillator value.

### ADX.js (Average Directional Movement Index)
- **Purpose**: Measures the strength of a trend.
- **Logic**: Uses the DX indicator to compute the ADX value, which smooths out the DX values over a period.

### ATR.js (Average True Range)
- **Purpose**: Measures market volatility.
- **Logic**: Uses True Range (TR) to calculate the average true range (ATR) over a specified period, smoothed using an SMA.

### CCI.js (Commodity Channel Index)
- **Purpose**: Identifies cyclical trends in a market.
- **Logic**: Uses typical price (average of high, low, and close) and compares it to the moving average of the typical price, normalized by mean deviation.

### DMI.js (Directional Movement Index)
- **Purpose**: Identifies trend direction and strength.
- **Logic**: Uses the ADX indicator to calculate DI (Directional Index) values for trend identification.

These indicators are typically used in conjunction to form trading strategies that signal buy or sell opportunities based on market conditions.
