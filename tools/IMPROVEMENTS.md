# Chart CCXT Recognition Improvements

## Summary of Changes

The `chart_ccxt_recognition.js` script has been completely rewritten with the following enhancements:

### Key Improvements

1. **Enhanced Deduplication Logic**
   - Only logs signal transitions when prediction actually changes (not on timestamp changes)
   - Reads existing log to maintain state across runs
   - Produces clean signal log suitable for downstream order automation

2. **Robust CSV Header Handling**
   - Gracefully handles duplicate/malformed CSV headers
   - Filters out empty lines and header rows using pattern matching
   - Robust validation of candle data (checks for positive prices, valid volume)

3. **Proper Candle Sorting**
   - Deduplicates candles by timestamp
   - Sorts candles chronologically for consistent processing
   - Handles various timestamp formats

4. **Efficient File Handling**
   - Better error handling and validation
   - Streaming-friendly approach for large datasets
   - Proper directory creation and file management

5. **Modern JavaScript Practices**
   - Comprehensive JSDoc documentation
   - Const/let usage instead of var
   - Arrow functions where appropriate
   - Better error handling with try/catch
   - Descriptive variable names and function names

6. **Enhanced Logging and Debugging**
   - Detailed console output with timestamps
   - Progress reporting during processing
   - Debug information for first few predictions
   - Clear error messages and warnings

7. **Signal Log Deduplication**
   - `deduplicateAndSortLogFile()` function removes duplicate timestamps
   - Maintains chronological order
   - Prevents log file growth from duplicates

### Technical Features

- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of CSV data and model files
- **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of missing files, corrupt data, and model errors
- **Performance**: Efficient processing of large datasets with minimal memory usage
- **Maintainability**: Clean, well-documented code structure

### Usage

```bash
node tools/chart_ccxt_recognition.js
```

The script now properly:
1. Reads OHLCV data from `../logs/csv/ohlcv_ccxt_data.csv`
2. Loads the latest trained model from `./trained_ccxt_ohlcv/`
3. Generates predictions and writes to `ohlcv_ccxt_data_prediction.csv`
4. Logs only actual prediction changes to `ccxt_signal.log`
5. Runs continuously every hour (configurable)

### Files Generated

- `ohlcv_ccxt_data_prediction.csv`: Contains all candles with predictions
- `ccxt_signal.log`: Contains only state transition signals (deduplicated)

The main improvement is the clean signal log that only contains actual prediction changes, making it ideal for downstream trading automation systems.
