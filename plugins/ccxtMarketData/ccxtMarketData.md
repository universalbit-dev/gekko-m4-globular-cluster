# CCXT Market Data Plugin

## Philosophy of Decentralization

> **Note:**  
> This plugin is built to reduce reliance on centralized data sources by leveraging decentralized, flexible configuration methods.

## ðŸš€ Dynamic Configuration Only

The **CCXT Market Data** plugin is configured entirely through dynamic settings, allowing you to adjust parameters at runtime using environment variables. This approach enhances flexibility, portability, and security for different environments and deployments.

### Example: Dynamic Configuration via Environment Variables

Set up your plugin in your strategy configuration file as follows:

```js
config.ccxtMarketData = {
  enabled: true,
  exchange: process.env.EXCHANGE_MARKET_DATA_ID,
  symbol: process.env.SYMBOL,
  interval: process.env.INTERVAL
};
```

**Environment variables you need to define:**
- `EXCHANGE_MARKET_DATA_ID` â€” The exchange identifier (e.g., `kraken`, `binance`)
- `SYMBOL` â€” The trading pair symbol (e.g., `BTC/EUR`)
- `INTERVAL` â€” The candle interval (e.g., `5m`, `1h`, etc.)

You can set these variables in your shell before starting the application:
```sh
export EXCHANGE_MARKET_DATA_ID=kraken
export SYMBOL=BTC/EUR
export INTERVAL=5m
node ccxtMarketData.js
```
