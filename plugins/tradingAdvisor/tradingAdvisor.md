The `tradingAdvisor.js` file in the `gekko-m4-globular-cluster` repository is responsible for managing the trading strategy and advising on trades based on the configured strategy. Here's a brief explanation of its key components:

- **Imports and Initialization**: 
  - It imports necessary modules like `underscore`, `events`, `fs-extra`, `util`, `moment`, and `log`.
  - It initializes configuration and directories using `util`.
  - It defines an `Actor` class which extends `EventEmitter`.

- **Constructor**:
  - Binds all functions to the `this` context using `_.bindAll`.
  - Initializes a `CandleBatcher` with the configured candle size.
  - Sets up the strategy by calling `this.setupStrategy()`.
  - Prepares historical data if running in 'realtime' mode using `dataStitcher`.

- **setupStrategy**:
  - Checks if the strategy file exists and requires it.
  - Wraps the strategy methods into a `WrappedStrategy` class.
  - Initializes the strategy with configuration settings.
  - Sets up event listeners for the strategy events such as `stratWarmupCompleted`, `advice`, `stratUpdate`, `stratNotification`, and `tradeCompleted`.

- **processCandle**:
  - Processes an incoming candle and writes it to the batcher.
  - Emits the processed candle to the strategy.

- **emitStratCandle**:
  - Propagates a custom-sized candle to the trading strategy.

- **processTradeCompleted**:
  - Processes a completed trade by invoking the strategy's `processTrade` method.

- **finish**:
  - Finishes the strategy by calling its `finish` method.

- **relayAdvice**:
  - Relays advice from the strategy by emitting an 'advice' event.

The `tradingAdvisor.js` file is crucial for handling the trading logic and connecting the strategy to incoming market data.
