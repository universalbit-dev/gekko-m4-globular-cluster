### License & Data Usage Note

This project does **not** copy, redistribute, or use ESA Gaia Archive data or Gaia source IDs.
Instead, it simulates star IDs and properties based on open astronomical coordinates (e.g., from Noctua Sky API) and visual inspection (e.g., using Stellarium GPL engine).

- **Problematic License for Crypto/Space Economy:**  
  While Gaia data is released under [CC BY 3.0 IGO](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/igo/), its license prohibits certain usages—such as commercial, financial, or blockchain asset/token creation—unless explicit permission is granted.
- **No REST API:**  
  ESA does not provide a public REST API for Gaia star data, which complicates dynamic or on-chain verification for blockchain or financial applications.
- **Compliant Simulation:**  
  This project simulates data to ensure full openness and compliance, making it suitable for research, digital asset/tokenization, and space economy use cases.

For more details, see the [ESA Gaia Archive](https://gea.esac.esa.int/archive/) and its license terms.
