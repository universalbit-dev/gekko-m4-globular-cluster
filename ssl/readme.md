- **`ssl/distinguished.cnf`** — SSL certificate configuration file

### 📦 How to Use
1. **Ensure you are you are inside the `ssl/` directory and that `distinguished.cnf` exists in this folder.**
2. **Make the setup script executable:**

   chmod +x https_ngc6121_setup.sh
   ```
3. **Run the setup script:**

   ./https_ngc6121_setup.sh
   ```

#### This script will:

- Configure Grafana for HTTPS
- Start the Grafana server

4. **Access Grafana:**  
   Open [https://localhost:3000](https://localhost:3000) in your browser.  
   *(You may see a browser warning about the self-signed certificate.)*
