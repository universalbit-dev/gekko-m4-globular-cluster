# Backtesting Documentation

## Overview
The `backtest.js` file in the **Gekko M4 Globular Cluster** repository facilitates backtesting of trading strategies using historical market data. It simulates market conditions to help users analyze the effectiveness of their strategies.

## Development Notes
The backtesting feature is currently **under development**, and the following limitations or changes should be noted:
- **On-the-Fly Data**: The current implementation skips some data validation and import steps for on-the-fly backtesting.
- **Structure and Logic Updates**: The structure and logic of the backtesting process are being actively modified and may change in future updates.

> ⚠️ **Note on Ambiguity:**  
> Sometimes, terms like "real world" and "virtual space" can be confusing, especially when discussing simulated and real environments together. If you find yourself unsure about the meaning, check out [Word-sense disambiguation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Word-sense_disambiguation) for more context on how words can have multiple meanings depending on the context.
