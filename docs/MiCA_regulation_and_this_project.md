## 🚦 When Does MiCA Apply?

> ⚠️ **If you use this bot for real trading (API keys, live exchange integration):**
>
> #### 🤖 Personal Use (Trading your own account)
> - You may use the bot to trade on your own exchange account with your own funds.
> - This is permitted under MiCA and does **not** make you a regulated service provider.
>
> #### 🏦 Managed Service or Trading for Others
> - If you operate the bot for others, manage their funds, or run it as a paid service, you may qualify as a "crypto-asset service provider" under MiCA.
> - You would then need:
>   - Authorization from EU regulators
>   - Compliance with user protection, KYC/AML, reporting, and operational standards
>
> #### 🔐 Summary
> - **Personal trading:** No MiCA registration required.
> - **Custodial or paid service:** MiCA registration and full compliance required.
>
> 📝 _Always verify your local laws, exchange terms, and MiCA updates before enabling real trading._
