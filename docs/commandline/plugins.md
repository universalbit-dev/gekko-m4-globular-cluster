### 4. Paper Trader
The **Paper Trader** plugin simulates trades based on Gekkoâ€™s advice. It helps in testing strategies without risking real money by swapping virtual assets and currencies.

#### Steps to Configure:

```javascript
config.paperTrader = {enabled: true,reportInCurrency: true,simulationBalance: {asset: 100,currency:1},feeMaker: 0.1,feeTaker: 0.1,feeUsing: 'maker',slippage: 0.05};
```
#### Configuration Options:
- `enabled`: Set to `true` to activate the plugin.
- `reportInCurrency`: If `true`, reports profit in currency; otherwise, in assets.
- `simulationBalance`: Sets initial simulated balances for assets and currency.
- `verbose`: If `true`, logs results after every candle; otherwise, after every trade.
- `feeMaker` / `feeTaker`: Percentage fees for maker and taker orders.
- `feeUsing`: Set to `'maker'` or `'taker'` to use the appropriate fee type.
- `slippage`: Percentage cost for slippage in trades.

## Notes on Fees and Slippage
When configuring the Paper Trader, consider the following:
- **Spread**: The typical market spread.
- **Order Book Depth**: The availability of liquidity at the top of the book.
- **Market Volatility**: Higher volatility increases the likelihood of slippage.
