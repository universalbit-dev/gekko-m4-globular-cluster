## ⚙️ How Does This Affect This Project?

- **gekko-m4-globular-cluster** is a tool for analyzing and simulating trading strategies.
- By default, it uses public market data and does not execute real trades or handle user funds.
- This means the app does **not** fall under MiCA’s licensing or compliance rules for crypto services.

> ⚠️ **What changes if you use this bot for real trades?**
>
> - 🤖 **Personal Use (You trade your own account):**  
>   You can use the bot to trade on your own exchange account with your own funds. This is allowed, and you do **not** become a regulated service provider under MiCA.  
>   _You are responsible for your own security and compliance with your chosen exchange's rules._
>
> - 🏦 **Running as a Service for Others (Managing other people's funds):**  
>   If you use the bot to trade for other people, manage their funds, or operate it as a business, you may become a "crypto-asset service provider" under MiCA.  
>   This means you could be required to:
>   - Get authorized by EU regulators  
>   - Follow strict rules for user protection, KYC (Know Your Customer), AML (Anti-Money Laundering), and reporting  
>   - Maintain operational and data security standards  
>
> - 🔐 **Summary:**  
>   - Using the bot for your personal trading is fine under MiCA.  
>   - Providing trading as a paid or managed service for others falls under regulation.
>
> 📝 _Always check your local laws and exchange policies before enabling real trading._
