Copilot Explanation of backtest.js

The `backtest.js` file is responsible for running backtests on historical market data. Here's a detailed explanation of its components and functionality:

1. **Imports and Initialization**:
    - **Modules**:
        - `bluebird`: A promise library.
        - `underscore`: A utility library.
        - `util`: Provides utility functions and configurations.
        - `moment`: A library for date and time manipulation.
        - `fs-extra`: A file system library.
        - `node-noop`: A no-operation function.
    - **Configuration**:
        - Retrieves configurations and directory paths.
        - Initializes logging and date range for backtesting.
        - Checks if the date range is valid and if the Paper Trader is enabled.

2. **Market Class**:
    - **Constructor**:
        - Binds all functions to the class instance.
        - Initializes properties like `pushing`, `ended`, and `closed`.
        - Logs warnings about backtesting and initializes the `Reader`.
        - Sets up the iterator for fetching data in batches.
    - **Prototype Methods**:
        - **read**: Initiates the data retrieval process.
        - **get**: Fetches a batch of historical data.
        - **processCandles**: Processes the retrieved candles, pushes them to the backtesting engine, and updates the iterator for the next batch.

3. **Error Handling and Logging**:
    - Checks for valid date ranges and configuration settings.
    - Logs warnings and errors related to data retrieval and processing.

The class uses event handling to process the end of the data stream and handle incomplete market data. The file also includes licensing information at the end.
