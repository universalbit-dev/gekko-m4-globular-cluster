# üìÑ How to Filter Logs to `generic.json` with realTimeProcessor.js

This guide helps you process your log data, filter out unwanted lines, and generate a clean, size-limited `generic.json` log file.

---

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Prepare Your Environment**  
- Make sure you have **Node.js** installed (`node -v` to check).
- Place `realTimeProcessor.js` in your project directory.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Run the Log Processor**

```sh
pm2 logs --json | node realTimeProcessor.js
```
- üèÉ This streams live logs from your PM2 processes directly into the script for real-time filtering.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ **How Filtering Works**  
The script will **automatically exclude lines** containing:
- `[INFO]` ‚ÑπÔ∏è  
- `[DEBUG]` üêû  
- `[WARNING]` ‚ö†Ô∏è  
- `[EXCHANGE SIMULATOR]` üß™  
- `[ERROR]` ‚ùå  
- `Wohoo!`, `(DEBUG)`, `"Emitted candles event"`, or a line of dashes

Only **valid JSON log lines** that do **not** contain these keywords are saved.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Where to Find Your Filtered Logs**

- The filtered logs are saved in:  
  **`generic.json`** üì¶

- **Log Size Limit:**  
  The file is capped at **1MB**.  
  Oldest entries are removed automatically to keep within this size.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ **If Something Goes Wrong**

- If `generic.json` contains invalid JSON, it is reset to an **empty array**.
- The script only writes valid JSON entries.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Stop the Script Gracefully**

- Press `Ctrl+C` ‚å®Ô∏è to stop.
- The script will flush the last buffered log entries before exiting.
